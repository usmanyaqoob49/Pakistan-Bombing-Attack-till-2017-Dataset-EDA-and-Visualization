# Pakistan-Bombing-Attack-till-2017-Dataset-EDA-and-Visualization
In this project I did a detailed EDA on the Data set of Zeeshan Usmani which has Data about Suicide Bombing Attacks till 2017. Firstly, I prepared data by doing Data Cleaning and Unit Conversion and added some other column to make things easy and then I did detailed Analysis and Visualization.
